<p><b>Martin Lewis OBE</b> has had quite the career, founding <b>moneysavingexpert.com</b> back in 2003 and becoming known widely across the UK as the go-to-man for honest money advise. However, in the last week information was leaked about <b>Lewis's latest success in Bitcoin Trading</b> - an area he'd previously advised the British Nation to be cautious of.
</p>
<aside class="read-more-links">
<h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="{offer}">“I just couldn’t ignore it anymore!” Lewis told Rose Hill, Daily Mirror. “I get so many messages through social media asking about Bitcoin, from people sharing their challenges with money, amongst other things. This whole system came about purely out of my obesession to want to help more british families become financially stable”</a>
</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<p>The new venture is called <a href="{offer}">Crypto Engine</a>, and although he didn't come up with the idea, he’s invested an estimated <strong>£1.2m</strong> of his own money into the software which enables anyone to trade Bitcoin profitably.</p>
<p><b>In a recent interview with Forbes, Martin revealed that more than half his business income for 2017 came from investing in one Bitcoin system.</b> His Bitcoin profits reportedly exceeded revenues from the hugely successful moneysavingexpert.com website.</p>
<aside class="read-more-links">
<h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="{offer}">"No one seems to have enough money, and I believe this is the solution people have been waiting for” said Martin. After ‘experimenting’ with multiple Cryptocurrencies; he explained: “I think Bitcoin is better than currency. People know how much I hate huge companies controlling everything, and <b>this new 'Crypto world' seems to be giving hard working, less fortunate people, a chance at creating financial freedom</b>.</a>
</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<p><b>Political Unrest</b> all over the world has caused people to look for a safe and stable asset, this has driven the demand for Bitcoin in the process; it’s completely decentralized and gives you full autonomy and protection over your funds for the first time ever, which Lewis suggests is just what the UK needs for it's economy struggles.</p>
<h2>“Bitcoin has increased in value by over 3000% in the last few years alone. The Crypto World is exploding with potential right now – this is the time to start and profit!”</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Lewis said how he came across the opportunity which is available to everyone right now: <i>“When I heard the idea, I just knew I had to be a part of it. We're going to change the lives of thousands of British people forever. I couldn’t be more excited!”</i></p>
<p><b>Here's why:</b> "A new way to live has emerged that 99.9% of the UK's population is unaware of. Times are tough, taxes are high and jobs are scarce. This program will give you access to this new economy and the opportunity to be your own boss. <b>Literally anyone can begin taking advantage of this and make proper money from the comfort of their own home.</b></p>
<p><a href="{offer}"><img src="images/kate-tweet.png"></a></p>
<h2>“If you had invested just $100 in Bitcoin back in 2010 you would now enjoy dividends of $75 Million Dollars!”</h2>
<p><b>Lewis says:</b> “It’s a controversial investment, because the world banking community does not want the average worker to have access to this much wealth outside of the system. <a href="{offer}">They literally hate me for investing in this!</a>, but they'll hate me even more for bringing it to everyone's attention” - Lewis laughed.</p>

</figure>
<p><b>Here's the deal:</b> The program is gaining major popularity and the results are astonishing. <b>Lewis explains how “timing is key with an opportunity like this and sadly the window for this is this is pretty small; many British people will miss out.</b> There really is just a few months or even weeks left to rake in that holiday money." <b>Economists are urging people to "Start Now!"</b></p>

<p><b>Sound too good to be true?</b> That's what single mum, Fiona Presley from Stevenage, initially thought too. Fiona is a 37-year-old mother of 2 boys who lost her job last October. She was lucky enough to be invited to beta test the program in January this year after stumbling across an ad on Facebook.</p>

<p><b>Fiona admits:</b> "At first, I thought this was a joke. Making money from home is only a dream, but I decided to try it anyway given my circumstances. I watched this video and then signed up. It was actually kinda fun learning something new. Money was flowing into my account, I didn't believe it was real. I was skeptical that I would receive a payout!”</p>

<a href="{offer}">"I now earn really good money just to work from home every day...and I get paid every Monday morning... I make around £7,000 a month right now and it’s creeping up every week. I receive my Bitcoin straight to my wallet, and if I need quick access I can transfer cash directly to my bank account by direct deposit, but I also have the option of <b>Paypal or Cheque</b> too!</a>
</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<p><a href="{offer}">What exactly is Fiona paid to do?</a> She says, "Essentially this new economy is Crypto Engine Auto Trading. You can trade it like stocks, but because it's a completely untapped market, there's no competition. I'm scooping up cash like ice cream. It's such a good time to be doing this and although I did my best to shield my kids from my challenges, they can clearly now see how much happier mummy is, and their toy cupboard is well stocked!"</p>
<p><b>What you need:</b> Only a computer, smartphone, or tablet with internet access. You don't need any specific skills other than knowing how to use a computer and browsing the internet. Another perk of this program is you get to choose your own hours. You can work completely on your own schedule- whether that's 5 hours a week or 50 hours a week. Absolutely no selling or telemarketing involved!</p>
<p>To save our reader’s time and double check the Crypto Engine's functionality, Fiona kindly created a guide to getting started on the system.</p>
<p>Here's her step-by-step walkthrough:</p>
<aside class="read-more-links instruction">
<h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Start Now</h5>
<p><a href="{offer}"><img src="images/uk-martin-lewis-mirror-step1.png"></a></p>
<p>First thing you see is a video showing off Crypto Engine in all of its glory. The advertising is big and bold and in your face but it is an American product and that's how they do things. Anyway, you simply submit your name and email address below the video to get started.</p>
<p><a href="{offer}"><img src="images/uk-martin-lewis-mirror-step2.png"></a></p>
<p>Next up, you're asked to <a href="{offer}">fund your account</a>. As I was navigating the deposit page, my mobile rang. It was an international number so I was hesitant to answer but then I realised it was obviously from Crypto Engine. Sure enough, it was my own personal account manager. His service was great. He took me through the entire funding process. They accept all major credit cards like Visa, MasterCard and American Express. I went ahead and deposited the minimum amount which is around £180 or $250 cause the platform works in US Dollars.</p>
<p><a href="{offer}"><img src="images/uk-martin-lewis-mirror-step3.png"></a></p>
<p>Once funded, I navigated to the "Auto-Trader" section of software, set the trade amount to the recommended $50 and enabled it. The Crypto Engine software started making trades at a rapid rate and I was concerned at first but let it do its thing. I left it active for about an hour and went and watched TV. When I came back, my account balance read $1,592.37! That's £1,127! I had just turned £180 into £1,127 in the space of an hour!</p>
</aside>
<p><b>Lewis says:</b> he’s inspired by the success so many are having with this, and hopes a renewed sense of optimism will sweep the nation as it gains momentum and more people reap the rewards for “seeing what I see here”.</p>
